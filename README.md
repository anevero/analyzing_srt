# Word statistics in subtitles

This script allows to get word statistics in subtitles for films and TV series.
It can work both with filesystem and remote providers (it can automatically
download subtitles using the title of the movie).


Minimum requirements:

* Python 3 (Python 3.6+ is recommended).
* [pysrt](https://github.com/byroot/pysrt) module.
* [subliminal](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal) module.


Modules can be installed automatically by the *srt_setup.py* script.
It's recommended to run this script before working with program to ensure
that all modules are installed properly.

This script was created as an example of solution of the test task for
